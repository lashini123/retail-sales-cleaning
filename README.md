# 📊 Retail Sales Data Cleaning & Analysis (Python, Pandas)

This project performs **end-to-end cleaning and exploratory analysis** on a real-world retail transactions dataset (Online Retail Dataset – UCI Repository).
The dataset contains **541,909 transactions** and includes product descriptions, quantities, prices, invoice dates, and customer IDs.

## 🚀 **Project Steps**

### **1. Load Dataset**

Loaded the Excel dataset and inspected:

* head (sample rows)
* data types
* missing values
* dataset shape

### **2. Data Cleaning**

Performed the following cleaning tasks:

| Cleaning Task                     | Description                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Drop missing product descriptions | 1,454 rows removed                                     |
| Remove duplicates                 | 5,268 duplicated rows removed                          |
| Remove invalid rows               | 9,725 negative quantities + 584 invalid prices removed |
| Ensure correct data types         | InvoiceDate converted to datetime                      |

After cleaning, **524,878 valid records** remained (from 541,909 original).

## 🧮 **Feature Engineering**

Created new columns to enable deeper analysis:

| New Column       | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `TotalPrice`     | `Quantity * UnitPrice` – revenue per line item |
| `Year` / `Month` | For time-based grouping                        |
| `InvoiceMonth`   | Month-level timestamp for trends               |
